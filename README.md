My project is a Library Management System (LMS) developed using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to list available books, borrow, return, and donate items via a simple console interface. The system uses two key structures: a main inventory list and a dedicated transaction log to track issued books and their borrowers. This design choice highlights my understanding of data modeling and integrity, as it ensures the inventory is always accurate and transactions are logged reliably. This foundational knowledge is directly transferable to managing large datasets and enforcing consistency in professional RDBMS and Big Data applications.
